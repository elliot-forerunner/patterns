# albumcolors
These color palettes were recreated by RJ Andrews during Advent 2019 from the late 1800s French _Albums de Statistique Graphique_. The original album maps are one of the highest achievements in thematic mapping. Visit [DavidRumsey](https://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/view/search?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort%2CPub_Date%2CPub_List_No%2CSeries_No&q=album+de+statistique&search=Go) to see each original map in its full glory.

Each recreated palette is comprised of several SVG patterns. SVGs are located in the [SVG folder](https://github.com/infowetrust/albumcolors/tree/master/SVG). Each SVG pattern is named by its Advent Day, Album year, and map number. Dec.19-1886.26-2 is the SVG swatch that corresponds to the second color from the 26th map in the 1886 Album, published in this Advent series on Dec 19, 2019.

For a nice introduction to the palettes see them in their original [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/infowetrust/status/1201281456409964550).

Details on each palette are in the accompanying [CSV](https://github.com/infowetrust/albumcolors/blob/master/albumColors.csv) with: Advent day, Rumsey list number, type of palette, qty of palette colors, and link to original inspiring map.
 
Let me know on Twitter [@infowetrust](https://twitter.com/infowetrust) if you make anything using these palettes. Future work may include additional documentation about map styling including a note on period typefaces.
